## How to build and contribute

TBD

## Books vis batch

This project contains steps to prepare assets for android application.

These steps are as follows:
1. Parse PDF to text (I expect correct cyrylic PDF)
1. Get nouns from text
1. User should manually analyze these words if they are meaningful for application
1. Get english translation for all words
1. Group words into synonyms sets
1. Download images for english translations (just works better than for ukrainian cases)
